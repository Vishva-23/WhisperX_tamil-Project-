# Project Overview

## Description:
This project aims to develop a system that can transcribe spoken Tamil audio from MP4 or WAV files into text and subsequently translate the transcribed Tamil text into English. The system will facilitate the processing of audio data in Tamil language, enabling users to understand and analyze the content of Tamil audio files more effectively.

## Features:
1. **Audio Input Support**: The system will accept Tamil audio files in either MP4 or WAV format.
2. **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Utilizing speech recognition technology, the system will transcribe the spoken Tamil audio into text format.
3. **Tamil to English Translation**: The transcribed Tamil text will be translated into English using machine translation techniques.
4. **Output Formats**: The final output will be provided in text format, both in Tamil and English, for easy access and understanding.
5. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface will be developed to allow users to upload audio files, view transcription and translation results, and download the processed text.
